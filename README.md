# Final Computer Vision Project: Bike Helmet Detection

This final computer vision project utilizes the [Real-ESRGAN model](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN) to enhance an image dataset obtained from the open-source website [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/). The enhanced images are then used to train a Bike Helmet Detection model using the YOLOv8 framework.

## Steps Involved

1. **Image Enhancement**
   - **Model Used**: [Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN)
   - **Purpose**: To enhance the quality of the image dataset obtained from Roboflow, improving the clarity and detail of the images.

2. **Model Training**
   - **Model Used**: YOLOv8
   - **Purpose**: To train a Bike Helmet Detection model using the enhanced image dataset.

## Summary

The project demonstrates the application of advanced image enhancement techniques and state-of-the-art object detection models to create an effective Bike Helmet Detection system. By leveraging the Real-ESRGAN model for image enhancement and YOLOv8 for object detection, the project aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of helmet detection in various images.
